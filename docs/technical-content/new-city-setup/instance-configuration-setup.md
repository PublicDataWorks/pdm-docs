# Instance Configuration Setup

## Before you begin
The Police Data Manager codebase is setup to be customizable for various cities. This guide will inform you about the various customizations and configurations that can be made to the application before you launch it for use. You can take a look at the Demo instance configuration files under `src/instance-files` and use this as a starting point.


### Letter Templates
These files are how you can customize the content of the letters that get created by Police Data Manager. We have two letter types, namely, Referral Letter (get sent to the Police Dept) and Complainant Letter (sent to the Complainant as an acknowledgement). 


### Letter Signatories
You can customize the names and signature images from the users of Police Data Manager. This would typically be your Complaint Intake Specialist or Police Monitor roles.


### Letterhead Logos
You can setup the letter with your organization's logo and brand using a specified image from the header and logo section.


### Letter Defaults
The default recipient of your Referral Letter including their name and address can be configured so all letters automatically get addressed to the correct person.
