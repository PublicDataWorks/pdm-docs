# Introduction to Police Data Manager
## Background and Purpose
[Police Data Manager](https://github.com/PublicDataWorks/police_data_manager) (PDM) was originally created for the Office of the Orleans Independent Police Monitor ([OIPM](http://nolaipm.gov/about-oipm/)). The OIPM is an independent, civilian police oversight agency created in August of 2009. One responsibility of the OIPM is to offer complaint intake services to the community to assist in raising complaints to the New Orleans Police Department. 

Before Police Data Manager was created the OIPM faced challenges with tracking, managing, and collaborating on complaint records. Complaint Intake Specialists working at the OIPM communicated with civilian and officer complainants in order to collect notes so that they could produce a referral letter to be sent to the NOPD. OIPM's complaint intake process would take days or weeks so that Complaint Intake Specialist could gather the necessary details about the officers involved, the time and location of the incident, as well as complainants' narratives. Complaint Intake Specialists also considered the accused officer's disciplinary history and suggested complaint classifications and recommended actions to be included within referral letters. 

Coordination between Complaint Intake Specialists over these days and weeks to process individual complaints was not a seamlessly collaborative effort, nor was there a clearly defined process to follow when collecting complaint information. Also, processed complaints were only available to review individually and no means to track complaint data collectively existed for analysis. OIPM helped influence the direction of PDM with these challenges in mind. 

## What is PDM?
The Police Data Manager is an open source tool meant to aid civilian police oversight agencies in generating complaint data. PDM is designed to be fully integrated into the workflows of these oversight agencies, enabling cities to enhance the capacity of citizens to hold public institutions accountable. 

With PDM organizations can align their processes to produce more consistent and effective complaints. Collecting complaint details (i.e. persons involved, incident time and location, complainant narratives, etc.) is captured in PDM's letter generation flow. Collaboration is encouraged through centralized case notes and notifications while also maintaining accountability through audit logs and complaint history. 

Additionally, the tool's carefully designed UI helps users to communicate with each other on specific complaints, virtually sign referral letters, find incident addresses, and search through existing complaints. 

This tool also enables analysis of complaint data through visualizations. We have recently introduced public facing data portals to further empower and advance the impact of civilian police oversight agencies.
