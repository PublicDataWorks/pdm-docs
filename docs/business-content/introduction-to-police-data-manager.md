# Introduction to Police Data Manager
## Business context (What?)

## Background and Purpose (Why?)
Police Data Manager was originally created for the Office of the Orleans Independent Police Monitor (OIPM). The OIPM is an independent, civilian police oversight agency created in August of 2009. One responsibility of the OIPM is to offer Complaint Intake services to the community to assist in raising complaints to the New Orleans Police Department. 

Before Police Data Manager was created, the OIPM faced challenges with tracking, managaging and collaborating on Complaint records. Complaint Intake Specialists working at the OIPM communicated with civilian and officer complainants in order to collect notes so that they could produce a referral letter to be sent to the NOPD. This process would take days or weeks so that Complaint Intake Specialist could gather the necessary details about the officers involved, the time and location of the incident, as well as the complainants' narratives. Complaint Intake Specialists also considered the accused officer's disciplinary history and suggested classification and reccommended actions within the letter. Coordination between Complaint Intake Specialists over these days and weeks to process individual complaints was not a seamlessly collaborative effort. Nor was there a clearly defined process to follow when collecting this information.
