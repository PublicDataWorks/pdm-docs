# Introduction to Police Data Manager
## Business context (What?)
 Police Data Manager is a tool...

## Background and Purpose (Why?)
This project originated in the minds of the Invisible Institute. The Invisible Institute is a journalist organization in Chicago that was instrumental in getting the Laquan McDonald shooting video released [year], which led to the officer who shot him to be indicted. We were approached by Invisible Institute in July of 2017 about helping them with their Citizens Police Data Project. They regularly use FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) to request police data from the city of Chicago and then make it available for the public to use. Citizens, journalists and civil rights attorneys use this to track complaints of misconduct by police officers and Use of Force incidents. It is often used as a common body of evidence in court and in reporting. 

As part of ThoughtWorks' Racial Injustice and Incarceration, we initiated a workshop with them earlier this year to identify areas of support they needed with the Citizens Police Data Project and other initiatives they're working on. A number of potential projects we could help them with were identified and we began work as a beach project in the Summer, with a team of devs. 

Their approach to mission impact has been so successful, other cities are asking to replicate their programs and platforms. Through our partnership with them, we now have the opportunity to work on the optimization of the Complaint Intake Process for the City of New Orleans which will then be replicated to the City of Chicago. We will be working closely with Stella Cziment, the deputy of the New Orleans Independent Police Monitor. The New Orleans Independent Police Monitor (NOIPM) is a civilian oversight agency that was established as a part of the consent decree that emerged from an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into a pattern of unlawful misconduct by the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD). They are responsible for receiving citizen complaints against the police department and for following up on investigations on behalf of the public.
